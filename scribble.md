Hi ya'll! I recently made the tough decision to leave my current role in web development despite working in a great company with wonderful colleagues. My first professional experience in this field taught me a lot about what's possible as a developer in the tech industry and gave me a much better idea of my dream role and where I want to see myself, and now I'm making this decision to have the time to fully commit to pursuing that role.

Specifically, I'm looking to move on from the work I was doing with static sites to be involved in more dynamic projects that will get me in better touch with the programming skills and concepts needed to develop into the 'wizardly' software engineer I want to be üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. In the meantime I'll be buffing out my portfolio with the technologies I want to work with - if anyone's interested in discussing or collaborating please reach out :).

If you know me you know that networking and expanding connections is not my strong suit, so by making this post that is exactly what I hope to be working on. Any advice, help, or guidance would be appreciated! Much love <3
